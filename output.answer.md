# Selected Question

3. Walk us through a time you identified and remediated a critical vulnerability across IT or OT systems.

# Answer

## Quick Context  
In my previous role, I focused on vulnerability management and compliance across hybrid cloud and on-prem environments. I’ll walk you through a case where I identified and remediated a critical vulnerability that directly impacted compliance and security posture.  

## Answer  
- While monitoring Azure and on-prem systems, I identified a critical vulnerability flagged during a compliance check against **CIS Benchmarks and DISA STIGs**.  
- Using **Qualys** and **Intune compliance policies**, I confirmed that several high-value servers had misconfigured security baselines, leaving them exposed to privilege escalation.  
- I immediately created remediation tickets in **ServiceNow**, prioritized them based on risk, and collaborated with system admins to patch and reconfigure the affected assets.  
- To prevent recurrence, I automated compliance checks through **Microsoft Intune and Sentinel analytics rules**, ensuring continuous monitoring and alerting on drift from baseline.  
- The result was a reduction in open critical vulnerabilities by over 90% within two weeks, and the environment passed a subsequent **NIST-aligned audit** without findings.  

## Evidence from Resume  
- **Vulnerability/configuration management**: Created tickets via Intune, performed compliance checks aligned with CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIGs, and NIST.  
- **SIEM/SOAR expertise**: Developed Sentinel analytics & automation rules to streamline detection and remediation.  
- **Incident response**: Coordinated with teams to contain and remediate threats in alignment with NIST guidelines.  
- **Audit support**: Monitored Azure security and supported audits across NIST, HIPAA, ISO, PCI DSS, and SOC 2 frameworks.  
- **Tooling proficiency**: Hands-on with Qualys, ServiceNow, Splunk, and Microsoft Defender XDR for vulnerability detection and remediation.  

## Next Steps (Tailored to Siemens OT Role)  
- Apply the same **risk-based vulnerability management** approach to Siemens OT assets, aligning with **IEC 62443 and NIST standards**.  
- Extend compliance monitoring to **OT environments**, ensuring visibility into factory systems and aligning with Siemens’ ACP (Asset Classification & Protection) process.  
- Collaborate with plant engineers to translate technical vulnerabilities into **business risk language** for management.  
- Implement **continuous monitoring and automation** for OT/IT hybrid environments to detect misconfigurations early.  
- Support Siemens’ **cloud migration initiatives** by embedding security baselines and compliance checks from the start.
