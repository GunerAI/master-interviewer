  "steps": [
    "Select a strong example from resume where candidate handled vulnerability management or compliance checks (e.g., Azure/Intune CIS Benchmarks, DISA STIGs, NIST).",
    "Briefly describe the context and system environment (cloud/IT with potential OT parallels).",
    "Explain how the vulnerability was identified (tools like Qualys, Sentinel, Splunk, Intune compliance checks).",
    "Detail remediation actions taken, including collaboration with teams and applying benchmarks or patches.",
    "Highlight measurable impact (reduced risk, passed audit, improved compliance).",
    "Conclude with lessons learned and how it applies to Siemens OT/IT hybrid environment."
